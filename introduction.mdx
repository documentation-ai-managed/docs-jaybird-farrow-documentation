## Integration with Professional Practice

You apply learned concepts directly in your fieldwork using the platform's mobile app for on-site references. Download templates for survey reports and share findings in real-time with teams. The framework supports certification renewals by tracking continuing education credits automatically.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript">
  ```python
import math

def calculate_bearing(start, end):
    dx = end[0] - start[0]
    dy = end[1] - start[1]
    bearing = math.degrees(math.atan2(dy, dx))
    return bearing % 360

start = (100, 200)
end = (150, 250)
print(f"Bearing: {calculate_bearing(start, end):.2f} degrees")
```
  ```javascript
function calculateBearing(start, end) {
  const dx = end.x - start.x;
  const dy = end.y - start.y;
  let bearing = Math.atan2(dy, dx) * (180 / Math.PI);
  return (bearing + 360) % 360;
}
const start = {x: 100, y: 200};
const end = {x: 150, y: 250};
console.log(`Bearing: ${calculateBearing(start, end).toFixed(2)} degrees`);
```
